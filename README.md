By Grace Yoo

**Programming Language Used:** Virtual Basic for Application (VBA)

<h2> Description</h2>
The purpose of this project is to use VBA to aggregate statistics on a stock market toy dataset with three years worth of data. The script loops through all stocks for one year and outputs:
- The ticker symbol
- Yearly Change from opening price to closing price
- Percentage Change from opening price to closing price
- Total stock volume
Additionally, the code finds and reports the stocks with the greatest percentage increase, decrease and total volume for that year.
